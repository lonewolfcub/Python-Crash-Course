If I were skilled at Python coding, I would build:

- A program to scrape and archive feeds from Facebook and Twitter etc
- A bot for Twitter, Slack, Discord and Telegram
 - I'd add functionality to these bots which made using these services easier
 - I'd explore if it was possible to scrape and archive the interactions on these channels
