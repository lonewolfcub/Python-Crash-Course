# Say hello to everyone
print ('Hello World!')

# Make an typo that does not generate an error
print ('Hallo Warld!')
# This does not cause and error as Python does not care about the value of the string
# Although misspelled, this python is syntactically correct

# Make an typo which generates an error
print ('Hello World!")
# This causes an error because matching delimiters are not used to enclose the string
# This means the string does not end
