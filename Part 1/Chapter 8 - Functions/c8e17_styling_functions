Refer to PEP8 for guidance on how to style functions:

https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/

 - Functions should have descriptive names

 - Function names should be comprised of lowercase letters and underscores

 - Module (and my extension python file names) should use these conventions too

 - Functions should have a docstring which explains what the function does

 - If you specify a default value for a parameter, don't uses spaces on either
   side of the equals sign:

        def function_name(parameter_0, parameter_1='default value'

 - Apply the same convention to keyword arguements in function calls:

        function_name(value_0, paramenter_1='value)

 - Stick to 79 characters per line, if your function definition is longer,
   format the input like this:

        def function_name(
                parameter_0, parameter_1, parameter_2,
                parameter_3, parameter_4, parameter_5):
            function body...

 - If your program has more than one function, seperate them with two blank
   lines for readability

 - import statements should be written at the beginning of the file, execept
   where files have comments to explain the function of the program
