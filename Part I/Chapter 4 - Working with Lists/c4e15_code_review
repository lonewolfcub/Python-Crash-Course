Some principles to stick to:

- Use four spaces for an indentation level, if you use tab, configure your text
  editor/IDE to insert 4 spaces instead
- Use less than 80 characters on each line and configure your editor to show
  this (unless using such short lines makes your code unclear!)
- Don't excessively pad your programs with blank lines. Use them to demarcate
  logical areas of code
