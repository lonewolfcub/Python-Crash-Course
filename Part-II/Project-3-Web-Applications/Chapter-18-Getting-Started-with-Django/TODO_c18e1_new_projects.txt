To get a better idea of what Django does, build a couple of empty projects
and look at what it creates  Make a new folder with a simple name, like
InstaBook or FaceGram (outside of your learning_log directory), navigate to
that folder in a terminal, and create a virtual environment  Install Django,
and run the command django-admin.py startproject instabook . (make sure you
include the dot at the end of the command)

Look at the  les and folders this command creates, and compare them to
Learning Log  Do this a few times until youâ€™re familiar with what Django
creates when starting a new project  Then delete the project directories
if you wish.
